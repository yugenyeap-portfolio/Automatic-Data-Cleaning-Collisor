# Automatic-Data-Cleaning-Collisor
An automatic data cleaner I created in python for my current job at Collisor

Within this program I created a more efficient way to format data into the format we require and organise courses into their categories automatically. It will also fuzzy match course names and insitution names to identify if it is an existing course.

This python program mainly uses the Numpy and Pandas library for data cleaning.
